\AbstractText%
{It has been almost 160 years since Charles Darwin set out the theory of evolution by natural selection.
This theory is broadly accepted these days.
However, it is still not completely understood how natural selection shapes particular cell mechanisms and behaviours.
This work aims to improve understanding of the role of natural selection on transcriptional responses and memory in five gene regulatory networks of \textit{E. coli}.

This will be done by comparing natural genotypic and phenotypic variation in these bacterial promoters to a neutral model.
Random promoter mutagenesis will be utilized to generate this neutral model.
We will use fluorescent reporters together with flow cytometry, fluorescent microscopy and microfluidics to quantify changes in expression levels and dynamics (i.e., noise, plasticity, speed, and sensitivity).
Studied sequences will be cloned into a plasmid-based model.

Initially, we used the well-studied \textit{lacZ} and \textit{recA} promoters to establish the main workflows.
Preliminary results show that both the sequence and genetic background have an effect on the promoter activity (i.e., there are both cis- and trans-effects).
To allow quantification in a chromosomal context, we constructed a new plasmid which enables chromosomal integration of \textit{promoter::GFP} sequences.

This study uses a collection of environmental \textit{E.~coli} isolates to look into how natural selection has acted on behavioural responses of bacteria really in nature, which is a novel approach as previous works focused mainly on lab strains.
