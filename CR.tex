\AbstractText%
{Within the Czech polar expeditions to Johann Gregor Mendel Station on James Ross Island, Antarctica, biotic and abiotic microbial samples were collected.
We picked out 439 presumptive pseudomonads isolated during the years 2011-2014 for further investigation.
Initial sorting based on two genus specific PCRs separated 240 strains of them as \textit{Pseudomonas} species and these were then more characterized.

Phenotypic methods included e.g. abilities to utilize various saccharides, growth on special media or under different temperature conditions.
Some results of biochemical tests were used for the preliminary species identification.
To show the overall phenotypic similarity of our samples we performed a cluster and an ordination analysis.
Both methods separated 28 strains with problematical identification from the main cluster.
They might be inaccurately included among pseudomonads by the genus specific PCRs.

For genotyping we used a repetitive PCR (rep-PCR) approach.
Surprisingly the dendrogram based on this method does not correspond with the phenotyping results.
Thus we chose eight strains for sequencing of three \textit{Pseudomonas} conservative genes (\textit{rrs}, \textit{rpoB} and \textit{rpoD}) to determine their taxonomic affiliation.

The established approach is possible to successfully use for \textit{Pseudomonas} species selection.
However, our results show how much the species determination of psychrotrophic isolates from Antarctica is limited on the phenotype level.
There still remains to verify the suitability of the rep-PCR method for genotyping of used strains.
