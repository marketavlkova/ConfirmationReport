\AbstractText%
{It is almost 160 years since Charles Darwin set out the theory of evolution by natural selection.
This theory is broadly accepted these days however, it is still not completely understood how does natural selection shape particular cell mechanisms and behaviours.
This work aims to get a better view on the role natural selection plays in transcriptional responses and memory in five transcriptional networks of a single species.

This will be done by comparing natural genotypic and phenotypic variation in promoters to a neutral model.
We will use fluorescent reporters together with flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy to quantify changes in expression levels and dynamics (i.e. noise, plasticity, speed and sensitivity).
To detect epigenetic memory and transcriptional responses under fluctuating conditions microfluidics will be performed.
Studied sequences will be cloned into plasmid based model, but chromosomal integration will take place as well.

For the beginning, well studied \textit{lacZ} and \textit{recA} promoters were used to establish the main workflows.
Preliminary results show that both the sequence and genetic background have effect on the promoter activity (i.e. cis- and trans- effect).
A new plasmid for chromosomal integration was also constructed in order to check  and correct for possible aberrations caused by plasmid based models.

This study brings a new way for studying natural selection, as previous works focused mainly on lab strains.
Here we use a collection of environmental \textit{E.~coli} isolates to look into how natural selection has acted really in the nature.
