\section{Cloned \tax{promoter::GFP} sequences}
As most of the strains listed in the Table \ref{strains} were prepared several years ago and not by myself, we wanted to check which parts of the promoters we actually have cloned upstream of GFP gene in those cells.
For this purpose I designed pUA66\textunderscore insert primers (Table \ref{pcr}) based on the pUA66 and pU139 vector sequences (\hyperlink{pUA66seq}{Appendix 1} and \hyperlink{pUA66seq}{Appendix 2}).
PCR products were sequenced by Macrogen, Korea using Illumina platform.

\subsection{\tax{placZ::GFP} strains}
In the Fig. \ref{placZ} we can see that SC1\textunderscore D9 and MG1655 differ in \tax{lacZ} promoter region by a single SNP at position 39 nt upstream from \tax{lacZ} gene start codon (position 199 in Fig. \ref{placZ}).
These 2 strains have 3 more SNPs further downstream in \tax{lacZ} gene itself 
(positions 306, 324 and 363 in Fig. \ref{placZ}).
Based on the alignment of acquired \tax{lacZ} promoters sequences (Fig. \ref{placZ}) we can confirm that those assumed to originate from SC1\textunderscore D9 have an appropriate sequence as well as for MG1655.

	\label{placZ}
\end{figure}
Beside the SNPs in \tax{lacZ} promoter, the first SNP from \tax{lacZ} coding sequence is included in all vectors upstream of GFP.
Most of the strains possess pU139 as the vector except for pZ1\textunderscore K12-K12 which was acquired from Alon library \cite{zaslaver2006comprehensive}.
This strain have also longer part of \tax{lacZ} gene cloned into its pUA66 vector, potentially covering second SNP in it when compared to SC1\textunderscore D9.
This is not the only difference of pZ1\textunderscore K12-K12, as part of the \tax{lacI} gene is incorporated in all sequences listed in Fig. \ref{placZ} on the opposite site of the promoter (\hyperlink{placZalign}{Appendix 3}) and pZ1\textunderscore K12-K12 has this \tax{lacI} sequence almost 60 bp shorter than the rest of these strains.
Note, that strain pZ1m1\textunderscore D9-K12 and pZ1m2\textunderscore D9-K12 possess a recurrent mutation of the SNP in \tax{lacZ} promoter or \tax{lacZ} gene, respectively (from SC1\textunderscore D9 back to MG1655).
%%% I SUPPOSE IT'S POSSIBLE TO SAY THE SEQUENCE ABOVE IN A BETTER WAY, BUT I COULD FIND IT...
You can also realize that strain pZ2\textunderscore K12-K12 is not included in the Fig. \ref{placZ}.
The reason is that it was made by transforming the plasmid from pZ2\textunderscore K12-D9 into MG1655 after receiving the sequencing data and was not sequenced afterwards.

\subsection{\tax{precA::GFP} strains}
Both pA\textunderscore K12-K12 and pA\textunderscore K12-D9 strains have the same plasmid (pU139) as the latter was made by transforming plasmid from the former.
It was also confirmed by sequencing as well as that the sequence upstream of GFP gene correspond to \tax{recA} promoter of MG1655 (\hyperlink{precAalign}{Appendix 4}).
Similar to the cloned \tax{lacI}-\tax{lacZ} intergenic regions mentioned above, the sequence incorporated into pU139 and then transformed into these \tax{precA::GFP} strains includes parts of \tax{recA} gene downstream and \tax{pncC} gene upstream of the very promoter.


\section{Variation in promoter activity}
To explore the differences in promoter activity and genetic backgrounds, 4 h cultures grown in M9 minimal media with a single carbon source were assayed using flow cytometry (see Materials and Methods).
Exported FCS files were then analysed in R - used scripts are available at \href{https://github.com/marketavlkova/}{GitHub} repositories.
